# Superbowl, TV and halftime shows
Analysing straight from wikipedia page.
      Super Bowl championships --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions
      Super Bowl tv ratings --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings
      Halftime musicians data --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows
In this project we get into an EDA regarding the results of the superbowl over time (combined points, score differences, blowouts etc)
and how this relates to other data, like the number of viewers and the quality of the halftime show.Specifically:
  - Visualising data of combined points
  - Visualising point differences. Also, checking for closest game(s) and biggest blowouts
  - Checking whether blowouts translate to lost viewers
  - Analysing viewership and the ad industry over time. Checking the ad cost over time and how the # of users relates to that
  - Counting halftime show appearances for each musician
  - Checking who performed the most songs in a halftime show
